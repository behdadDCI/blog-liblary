    desc: "Now popularly shortened to Alice In Wonderland, this book by Lewis Carroll is the most widely beloved British Children’s book. Written by Lewis Carrol, the book was published in 1865 and it quickly became one of the most popular works of English-language fiction. The story centers around a young girl named Alice, who falls asleep in a meadow and dreams that she follows the White Rabbit down a rabbit hole. She has many astonishing, often extraordinary adventures with thoroughly illogical and strange creatures. Alice often changes in size unexpectedly as she grows as tall as a house and shrinks to 3 inches in another part of the book.The story was originally told by Carroll to Alice, Lorins, and Edith Liddell; Henry George Liddell’s daughters on a picnic in July 1862. Alice asked Carroll to write out the stories for her to which he responded by giving her a hand-lettered collection titled Alice’s Adventures Under Ground. A visitor visited the Liddell home, saw the Storybook and advised Carroll to publish it. Carroll revised the hand letters, expanded them and this classic was born.The book appeared at a time when children’s literature was generally about teaching moral lessons. Critics were harsh on the book and failed to appreciate the nonsense that so captivated young children. But Carrol understood how children’s minds worked, and the way he turned logic on its head appealed to them. The work gained so much popularity, leading Carroll to write consequent books in the series like “Through the Looking-Glass, and “What Alice Found There.” The book has also inspired numerous theatrical performances, ballets, and films.",

Absalom discusses the rise and fall of Thomas Sutpen, a white man born into poverty in West Virginia who moves to Missipi with the ambition of gaining wealth and becoming a powerful family patriarch. Quentin Sutpen mostly narrates the events that sum up the plot of the novel to Shreve, his roommate at Harvard University, who repeatedly contributes his own suggestions and surmises. One of the unique things about this book is its use of flashbacks, as the whole book is completely told in flashbacks. Additionally, the novel Absalom, Absalom! is an allegory of Southern history. If you look at the title itself, it is an allusion to a wayward son fighting the empire his father built. This is similar to the story of King David and Absalom in the Bible.",

David Copperfield was published serially between 1849-50 and was published in book form the same year the series ended.According to Charles Dickens, the novel was his own “favorite child” and remains one of his most popular books to date. The book is semi-autobiographical. Even though the title character is not the same as Charles Dickens in many ways, Dickens related early personal experiences that had meant a lot to him. Some of these experiences include his schooling and reading, friendships and love life, his work in a factory, and even more curiously, his emergence from a parliamentary reporter to a successful novel writer.However, despite the many similarities, there are many differences between the lives of the two. For instance, while David grew up in the country as an only child, Dickens was a city boy with many sisters and brothers. Also, Dickens never had any great aunt or wicked stepfather. All through the novel, David is scarcely called by his birth name (except by Mr. Murdstone) rather, he is called Trot, Trotwood, Davy, Doady, and Daisy. Here is a fun fact, David Copperfield’s birth name is gotten from Dickens inverted initials.",
